# Podcast App

A project encompassing various technologies and aiming for cross-platform compatibility.

## Key Features & Benefits

- **Cross-Platform Development:** Leverages Flutter for potentially targeting multiple platforms (Android, iOS, Web, Desktop) from a single codebase.
- **Diverse Technology Stack:** Demonstrates proficiency in a range of languages and tools, including C++, JavaScript, Kotlin, Swift, TypeScript, and Node.js.
- **Modular Architecture:** Structured file system suggests a well-organized and maintainable project.

## Prerequisites & Dependencies

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

-   **Flutter SDK:**  Download and install the Flutter SDK from [https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).  Follow the platform-specific instructions.
-   **Android Studio:** (For Android development) Download from [https://developer.android.com/studio](https://developer.android.com/studio).
-   **Xcode:** (For iOS development) Available on macOS via the App Store.
-   **Node.js:** (For JavaScript-related tasks) Download from [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/) and npm package manager, which is included with Node.js.
-   **C++ Compiler:** Required for any C++ components. Specific compiler depends on the target platform (e.g., GCC for Linux, Clang for macOS/iOS).
-   **Kotlin:** Required for any Kotlin components. Typically managed through Android Studio.
-   **Swift:** Required for any Swift components. Typically managed through Xcode.
-   **TypeScript:** Necessary for any TypeScript files. Can be installed using npm: `npm install -g typescript`

## Installation & Setup Instructions

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/sabareesh-ck/ncast.git
    cd ncast
    ```

2.  **Install Flutter Dependencies:**

    ```bash
    flutter pub get
    ```

3.  **Android Setup (if targeting Android):**

    a.  Open the `android` folder in Android Studio.

    b.  Ensure the `google-services.json` file is correctly placed in the `android/app` directory if your app uses Firebase services.

    c.  Build the Android project within Android Studio to resolve dependencies.

4. **iOS Setup (if targeting iOS):**

    a. Open the `ios/Runner.xcworkspace` in Xcode.
    b. Select your target device/simulator
    c. Build the iOS project within Xcode to resolve dependencies.

5.  **Node.js Dependencies (if applicable):**

    If your project utilizes Node.js components, navigate to the relevant directory within the project and run:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

## Usage Examples & API Documentation

Detailed API documentation and specific usage examples are unavailable without further context on the project's purpose.  However, consider the following general guidelines based on the file structure:

-   **Flutter Application:** Refer to the Flutter documentation ([https://docs.flutter.dev/](https://docs.flutter.dev/)) for information on building UIs, handling data, and implementing functionality. The `README.md` within the Flutter project provides a basic getting started guide.

-   **Node.js Modules:** If specific Node.js modules are present, consult their individual documentation for API usage. For example, the `@fastify/busboy` module relates to handling file uploads in a Fastify web application. Refer to the Fastify and busboy documentation for details.

## Configuration Options

Configuration options vary depending on the specific components within the project.  Look for configuration files (e.g., `analysis_options.yaml` for Flutter analysis settings, `build.gradle` for Android build settings, and `.vscode/launch.json` for debugging configurations).

Environment variables may also be used, particularly for Node.js components. Consult any relevant configuration files or documentation for specific environment variable names and their purposes.
